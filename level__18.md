-The  contract expects us to pass an address of another contract that returns 42 when whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() is called

-Solidity-generated bytecode is large and contains extra logic.So, We need to deploy a contract with very minimal bytecode

-We need to make an EVM bytecode manually that stores 42 in memory and returns 32 bytes starting at memory position 0.

-The creation bytecode must return this runtime bytecode during deployment

-Once deployed,we can register it using setSolver() on the Ethernaut contract
