-We can use Etherscan and find the transaction that created the contract. Follow the flow of the 0.001 ETH to find where it went.
Look for the final address where the ETH was sent.

-We can use the final address to interact with the contract in remix and also use the contract's ABI

-We can call the destroy function and pass the player's address to self-destruct the contract and send the remaining balance to the player
