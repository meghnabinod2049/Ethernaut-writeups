-We need to allow DEX to transfer our tokens

-DEX sets swap prices based on the toekn balances. So when one token's balance drops, the price swings.

-We can manipulate repeadetedly by swapping the full balance back and forth

-As we swap more, it will manipulate the DEX and completely drain one token's supply from DEX

-When the toekn balance hits zero, we have completed.
